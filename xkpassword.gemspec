  Passwords are hard to remember, specially when they are hard to crack. I'd spend countless hours
  every eyar resetting passwords and eventually running out of options that I can remember. I found
  an interesting concept among a comic XKCD, it is to generate passwords using words and thus easier
  to remember. Here is XKPassword, a lib which you can install to our Ruby app or run indipendant
  in the command line.

  Wish you a safer future.
